Nikola Jokić is an unstoppable force in today's NBA -- if anyone is doubting this, just take a look at his most recent performances:

| Date      | Game       | MIN | PTS | REB | AST | FG%   |
|-----------|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-------|
| 3/3/2023  | DEN vs MEM | 35  | 18  | 18  | 10  | 70.0% |
| 2/28/2023 | DEN @ HOU  | 28  | 14  | 11  | 10  | 63.6% |
| 2/26/2023 | DEN vs LAC | 42  | 40  | 17  | 10  | 66.7% |

He's averaging a triple-double this season at an absolutely incredible FG% too -- 63.4% at the moment! The shots he takes, he makes. This isn't a case of stat-padding either, as the Denver Nuggets win every time he has a triple-double (25-0).

The current NBA ladder has Jokić at #1, followed closely by Giannis Antetokoumnpo at #2, and Jayson Tatum at #3. It's interesting that Joel Embiid has been pushed out of the picture at the moment. However, we still have half a season left, so that's a conversation for another day.

When comparing the top 3 MVP candidates, we see that the three are pretty neck-and-neck in PAR (Points + Assists + Rebounds).

It's clear that in today's NBA, you have to be a great shooter, a great playmaker, and a great rebounder to be considered in the "who's the best?" conversation. Depending on who you ask, a great shooter is one of: someone who gets their shots in more often than not, someone who scores the most points, or most wisely, a combination of the two. Currently, Jokić is dominating in FG% among the top 3 MVP candidates:

So what's left to compare? Wins -- the Nuggets are #1 in the Western Conference, while the Milwaukee Bucks are #1 in the Eastern Conference, followed closely by the Boston Celtics. It's clear that these players are MVP candidates for a reason.

Further comparison? That would be on the difficult of competition, and game point differentials. However, it's important to remember that at the end of the day, basketball is a team sport. These players have a tremendous affect on the game, and a great positive impact on their team, but at the end, teams are what win basketball games.

I hope to revisit this at various points in the season. There's still quite a lot of time left, but I don't believe that the standings will change all too much from now and when the regular season concludes.

Why shouldn't Nikola Jokić get his third consecutive MVP? Well, no reason. He should.
