It was an academic project that involved conducting a literature review and creating a personalized and gamified learning platform for students to learn about the basics of programming.This project was done under the supervision of Dr. Hazra Imran at Simon Fraser University. The project was written in JavaScript and used React & Firebase.","iode-programming-language#Iode (Programming Language)":"Iode is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript. There was a time when I was really into programming languages, and Iode was my attempt to create a language that I would like to use.\nAt one point, I worked on rewriting it in the D programming language, but I never finished it. It got as far as generating bytecode though! The JavaScript-target version of Iode still works rather well.","nba-salaries-data-science-experiment#nba-salaries (Data Science Experiment)":"A personal project that encompasses NBA data scraping, data cleaning, data transformation, and a neural network model.Something that stood out to me at first, but made more sense when I thought about it was the low(-er) correlation between salary and 3-pointers. When you think about it, players like Jokic + Gobert + Embiid hardly take that many 3-pointers, but are among the highest paid NBA players.This is the correlation matrix (2021-22 is the salary variable):","kite-html-templating-engine#kite (HTML Templating Engine)":"I originally made this when I was 14, back in 2015. I did not know about Angular / React / whatever popular framework was out there, so I made my own templating engine. It was super small (634b) and worked like a charm!To get it, one would just add this script to their HTML file:\n<script src=\"https://github.com/danilolekovic/kite.git\"></script>\nAnd then have a 'component' file like test.html:\n<p>Hello world!</p>\nAnd then, in the HTML file, you would have:\n<kite src=\"test.html\"></kite>\nAnd it would render the component in the HTML file.","pitfall-game#Pitfall (Game)":"This is a game I made in 2016. It's a clone of the classic Atari game, Pitfall. This was my term project for my game development class in high school.I used pygame and it had all of the features of the original, plus powerups and an in-game shop."}},"/tags/[tag]":{"title":"Tagged Posts","data":{"":""}}}
