In the 2023 playoffs, he averaged 10.5 points, 3.0 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 6 games. In the regular season, he averaged 14.3 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 2.6 assists in 73 games. He&#x27;s also a dog on defence, so-to-say. Despite Brooks&#x27; struggles with field-goal shooting during the 2023 playoffs, his overall impact on the court cannot be denied. Several teams could benefit from having a gritty player like him.</p>
<p>The Houston Rockets have struggled in recent years and are in the midst of some kind of semi-rebuild? It&#x27;s hard to understand exactly what is going on there, although adding a player like Brooks could help speed up the process of whatever is going on over there. Brooks&#x27; toughness and defensive intensity could set the tone for the team.</p>
<p>The Minnesota Timberwolves, on the other hand, already have a solid core of young players in Karl-Anthony Towns and Anthony Edwards. Adding Brooks could provide some veteran leadership and further playoff experience to the team. However, if the Timberwolves are able to bring back Patrick Beverley, they may not need to pursue Brooks, as Beverley would provide a similar skillset.</p>
<p>One team that could use Dillon Brooks&#x27; skills is the Dallas Mavericks. The Mavericks have struggled in the playoffs in recent years, and adding a player like Brooks could help improve their chances of making a deep playoff run. Brooks would provide the Mavericks with a consistent scoring option and a tough defender, which are areas they have been horrendous in this past season (especially defence).</p>
<p>Another team that could use Brooks&#x27; services is the Miami Heat. The Heat have a strong defensive identity, and adding a player like Brooks would only enhance their defensive prowess. However, I&#x27;d wager that this is the least-likely destination, especially if the Heat reaches the finals.</p>
<p>Whatever team picks up Brooks should keep in mind that he appears to be incredibly affected by the media and the fans. He received more than his fair share of criticism in the playoffs this year for his Draymond-like attitude and absurd comments. For example, on LeBron James:</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#x27;t care, he&#x27;s old,&quot; Brooks said. &quot;I poke bears. I don&#x27;t respect no one until they come and give me 40.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, it just happened to be that the Lakers eliminated the Grizzlies with a 40 point difference.</p><footer class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07"><small class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07"><time class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07">2023</time> © Danilo Lekovic<a href="/feed.xml" class="jsx-2447ca1c11803f07">RSS</a></small></footer></article></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/posts/next-for-brooks","query":{},"buildId":"ErgEVIeIetz12ho2kfrkJ","assetPrefix":".","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
